## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Node.js 18+
- Azure OpenAI Service access

### Setup

1. **Environment variables** (create `.env` file):

   ```env
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token
   ```

2. **Start backend**:

   ```bash
   dotnet run --launch-profile https --environment Development
   ```

3. **Start frontend**:

   ```bash
   cd client-app

   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access**: Frontend at `http://localhost:5174`, API at `https://localhost:7001`

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Token Metrics Display

Control the visibility of token usage and cost information in code review results by editing `appsettings.json`:

```json
"CodeReview": {
  "MaxFilesToReview": 3,
  "MaxIssuesInSummary": 3,
  "ShowTokenMetrics": true  // Set to false to hide token/cost info
}
```

When enabled, token usage and estimated cost are displayed at the top of review summaries for:

- 🧠 Train AI reviews
- 📝 Commit reviews
- 🔀 Pull request reviews

## ⚙️ Usage

1. Open web interface
2. Connect GitHub repositories in **Repositories** tab
3. Browse commits and pull requests
4. Customize AI prompts in **System Prompts** tab
5. Run automated code reviews
6. View token usage and cost metrics (configurable via `appsettings.json`)

## 🤝 Real-Time Collaboration

Create collaborative review sessions where multiple team members can review code simultaneously:

- **👥 Live Presence**: See who's currently reviewing with real-time participant lists
- **🖱️ Cursor Tracking**: Track where team members are looking in the code
- **💬 Live Comments**: Add comments on specific code lines with instant synchronization
- **🎨 Comment Types**: General, Suggestion, Question, Issue with threaded discussions
